# Evaluator property records

This part holds the long-horizon evaluator's property records. The evaluator
measures whether a coding agent keeps using the right project knowledge as
project history grows. Its records are `test-only`: the evaluator is a new
subsystem with no production caller, so they live here as one part with
cross-links from the stage catalogs rather than inside those catalogs, where
they would distort reachability summaries.

Records enter this directory when their checks are re-verified at the
then-current HEAD, in the METHOD field order from [`../METHOD.md`](../METHOD.md).
Until then, this file lists the executed checks the Phase 0 regression net
provides, so a reader can find them by test name.

## Phase 0 executed checks

Manifest, identity, and residue (`crates/eval-core/tests/manifest.rs`):

- `required_fields_are_sorted_and_equal_the_struct_field_set` pins
  `eval-manifest/v1` to `REQUIRED_FIELDS`; a struct field added without a
  version bump fails here. `fixture_digests_are_frozen` pins the fixture's
  `eval_run_id` and manifest digest so an encoding change is reviewed.
- `every_missing_field_is_refused_by_name_before_digesting`,
  `unknown_field_wrong_schema_and_non_object_are_refused`,
  `manifest_consistency_refusals_name_their_cause`,
  `residue_declarations_are_non_keep_and_one_rule_per_field`,
  `validate_refuses_what_parse_and_digest_refuse`, and
  `attestation_is_a_tagged_value` cover the typed refusals and the tagged
  attestation.
- `every_kept_field_enters_the_digest_and_every_dropped_field_leaves_it`
  mutates each kept field through a valid manifest and expects a new digest,
  and restamps the dropped fields expecting the same digest.
- `run_id_is_the_protocol_digest_of_the_full_tuple` recomputes `eval_run_id`
  with an independent SHA-256 over the nine-component tuple;
  `changing_any_identity_or_build_component_changes_the_run_id` mutates every
  component and every build sub-record field;
  `identity_validate_refuses_what_the_run_id_refuses` and
  `malformed_or_empty_identity_components_are_refused` cover the zero-bytes
  digest, malformed digests, and empty version strings.
- `residue_classification_is_total_over_observation_fields`,
  `clock_named_keep_fields_equal_the_pinned_allowlist`,
  `host_environment_and_incarnation_fields_are_never_kept`,
  `presence_and_relative_rules_hide_incarnation_values_but_not_their_structure`,
  `a_refused_observation_leaves_relative_numbering_unchanged`,
  `a_kept_value_the_digest_cannot_encode_is_refused_at_record_time`,
  and `dropped_fields_never_reach_the_trace_digest` cover the residue rules.
- `fractions_travel_as_canonical_decimal_strings` covers the decimal-string
  rule for rates and for `root_seed`.

Cross-process determinism (`crates/eval-core/tests/two_process.rs`):

- `two_process_same_identity_yields_equal_manifest_and_trace_digests` runs two
  child processes of the test binary, compares their digests with each other
  and with the parent's own computation.
- `two_process_planted_map_order_leak_fails_the_equality_test` is the negative
  control: a `Keep` field built from `HashMap` iteration order makes the same
  comparison fail, and a same-process check shows array order enters the
  trace digest.
- `two_process_changed_build_component_fails_the_identity_check` changes the
  code SHA in one child and expects a different `eval_run_id` and manifest
  digest with an unchanged trace digest.

Surface census (`crates/daemon/src/transform/surface_census.rs` and
`crates/daemon/tests/surface_census.rs`):

- `auto_search_is_enabled_by_the_wire_default_and_drives_the_hint_query`
  deserializes a request without the field, then runs the transform with the
  default, with `auto_search_enabled: false`, and as a subagent, counting hint
  queries. The plugin side is pinned by
  `packages/opencode-plugin/src/hooks/context/rust-mode-transform.test.ts`,
  which asserts the transform body carries `serve_native: true` and
  `auto_search_enabled: true` under default configuration.
- `surface1_stages_are_anchored_to_production_symbols_in_pinned_order` binds
  each of the thirteen `eval_core::Surface1Stage` values to the production
  symbol path that implements it and checks the row order against
  `SURFACE1_STAGES`.
- Order facts witnessed by behavior:
  `suppression_and_the_length_gate_return_before_any_query` and
  `the_token_gate_returns_before_the_candidate_window_reads_the_store` (through
  the store's statement probe). Decision
  freeze is witnessed by `empty_user_hint_decision_skips_future_queries` in
  `crates/daemon/src/transform.rs`; overlay apply by the aged golden below.
  The threshold reads only the top-ranked score and the cap keeps the
  top-ranked result, so threshold-before-cap has no observable effect and is
  pinned by symbol only, like deferral and native attachment, which have no
  per-hint seam until the Phase 2 taps land.
  `the_threshold_empties_a_result_set_the_cap_would_otherwise_trim` witnesses
  that the threshold is all-or-nothing: five below-threshold candidates yield
  no results, not three.
- Bounds witnessed by behavior: `hint_bound_constants_equal_the_evaluator_pins`,
  `the_candidate_window_holds_exactly_one_hundred_segments`,
  `the_query_keeps_twenty_four_tokens`, `three_results_survive_the_cap`,
  `two_matched_tokens_gate_the_query_and_filter_candidates`,
  `fragments_are_cut_at_eighty_units`, and
  `the_whole_hint_is_cut_at_eight_hundred_units`.
- `surface_two_and_the_query_route_are_default_closed` sends
  `retrieval.query`, `retrieval.prepare`, `retrieval.apply`, and
  `retrieval.confirm` to a stock daemon and expects `disabled` for each. The
  installed-installer arms that show the same routes answering are
  `scope_harness_and_disable_are_decided_before_any_candidate_read` in
  `crates/daemon/tests/query_route_handler.rs` and
  `the_route_is_disabled_until_an_approved_limit_set_is_installed` in
  `crates/daemon/tests/edit_receipts.rs`.

Fresh versus aged transform goldens
(`crates/daemon/src/transform/aged_goldens.rs`,
`crates/daemon/testdata/aged-transform-golden.json`):

- `aged_history_changes_the_tail_only_when_it_matches_the_prompt` runs the
  same prompt through the transform path in a fresh world and in a hand-built
  aged world, and compares the tail text and wire digest of each against the
  golden. One case's aged history matches the prompt and attaches a hint; the
  other's is irrelevant and attaches none.
- `a_dropped_attachment_fails_the_aged_golden` drops the attachment through the
  production switch (`auto_search_enabled: false`) and expects the golden
  comparison to fail while the fresh arm still matches.
- `aged_golden_provenance_covers_every_case_input` recomputes the fixture's
  `input_sha256` over every case input and rejects a one-byte perturbation.

Placement fences (`scripts/forbid-test-support-dependencies.ts`, run in the
`gates` CI job):

- No normal, build, or target-specific dependency table names the dev-only
  `eval-core` package or requests a feature that turns on test-support in the
  target package, directly or through a forwarding alias in the target's
  feature table or in a local package that table forwards to, and no local
  package's `default` feature enables its own
  `test-support` or reaches a `*/test-support` entry.

## Gaps recorded here

- Every ingestion entry point lacks a production caller. No world is labelled
  "validated real ingestion" until one exists; manifests carry
  `adapter-ingested, production caller: none` once ingestion lands.
- The 800-unit total cap is not reachable through `render_user_hint` under the
  80-unit fragment cap and 3-result cap; the census exercises the cap function
  directly.
- Residue rules apply to top-level observation fields. Nested values under
  `Keep` enter the digest whole; per-tap observation schemas in Phase 2 must
  flatten or register nested records.
