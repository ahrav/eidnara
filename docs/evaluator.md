# Evaluator core

`crates/eval-core` holds the value-level contracts of the long-horizon
evaluator: the run manifest, run identity, residue rules, and the surface
census pins. It is sans-I/O. Every function takes values and returns values;
the runner shell owns processes, stores, clocks, temp roots, and the build
sub-record.

## Placement fences

- `[dependencies]` is exactly `context-core`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `sha2`.
  No kernel, daemon, retrieval, storage, memory-store, host-runtime, rusqlite,
  or tokio edge.
- `eval-core` appears in the workspace only under `[dev-dependencies]`
  (`crates/daemon`). `scripts/forbid-test-support-dependencies.ts` rejects a
  normal, build, or target-specific edge to it, and rejects any such edge whose
  requested features turn on test-support in the target package, either by
  naming a `*test-support` feature or by reaching one through the target's
  feature table (a forwarding alias such as `bench = ["kernel/test-support"]`
  counts). It also rejects a local package whose `default` feature enables its
  own `test-support` or reaches a `*/test-support` entry. The `gates` CI job
  runs the scan.
- Digests come from `context_core::canonical_json::protocol_digest`, which is
  public so callers name a protocol string instead of restating the
  `<protocol>\n<canonical JSON>` framing.

## Manifest `eval-manifest/v1`

`parse_manifest` reads a JSON object, compares its key set against
`REQUIRED_FIELDS`, checks the `schema` literal, and only then deserializes and
validates. Refusals are typed: `MissingField(name)`, `UnknownField(name)`,
`SchemaMismatch`, `RunIdMismatch`, `GeneratorVersionMismatch`,
`ClaimBoundaryMismatch`, `ResidueIncomplete`, `ResidueContradiction` (a `Keep`
entry or two rules for one field), `SampleOrderNotAPermutation`,
`MalformedDigest`, `MalformedDecimal`, `RateOutOfRange` (an arm rate outside
`[0, 1]`), `EmptyComponent` (an empty component version, tokenizer name or
revision, or attestation signer), `NotCanonical` (an integer outside the
canonical safe range). `Manifest::validate` is public so a manifest built in
code can be checked before it is written; it applies every check above except
the key-set closure, so a manifest it accepts also parses and digests. Adding a
field to `Manifest` without bumping the schema fails the closure test, and the
fixture digests in `tests/manifest.rs` are frozen so an encoding change is
reviewed.

The 24 required fields, sorted:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `arm_rates` | Per-arm miss and refusal rates as exact decimal strings. |
| `attestation` | Tagged: `{"kind": "none"}` or `{"kind": "signed", ...}`. |
| `claim_boundary` | The `claim-boundary/v1` block with the four exclusions. |
| `component_versions` | Seven versions: generator, event schema, reducer, oracles, execution image, task corpus, judge. |
| `construction` | `replay`, `bulk`, or `hand_built`. |
| `cut_receipts` | Cuts from the closed set (`AfterAtomicTransition`, `AtQuiescence`, `AfterRecovery`, `AfterFaultPhase`, `EndOfRun`) with `reached` or `not_reached`. |
| `end_ms`, `start_ms` | Wall-clock stamps from the shell. |
| `envelope_bounds` | Declared resource bounds. |
| `envelope_peaks` | Observed peaks; a measurement, so it leaves the digest. |
| `error` | Typed error text or `null`. |
| `eval_run_id` | The run identity digest. |
| `reachability` | `default-production`, `explicit-config-only`, or `test-only`. |
| `residue` | Every non-`Keep` field with its rule, including the manifest's own. |
| `result_digest`, `witness_digest` | Lowercase hex SHA-256. |
| `retry_lineage` | Prior `eval_run_id` values of retried attempts; each is lowercase hex SHA-256. |
| `run_identity` | The nine-component identity tuple, including the build sub-record, the eligibility-spec digest, and the linearization rule version. |
| `sample_epoch`, `sample_ids`, `sample_order` | Stable sample identity and execution order; `sample_order` must be a permutation of `sample_ids`. |
| `schema` | `eval-manifest/v1`. |
| `status` | `completed`, `incomplete`, `refused`, or `blocked`. |
| `tokenizer_profile` | Name, revision, digest. |

`Manifest::digest` re-parses the manifest, applies the manifest's own residue
rules (`start_ms`, `end_ms`, and `envelope_peaks` are `Drop`; everything else
is `Keep`), and hashes with protocol `eval-manifest-digest/v1`. Two processes
with the same identity produce the same digest.

Canonical JSON rejects fractional numbers, so every fraction is a canonical
decimal string: `is_canonical_decimal` accepts `0`, `12`, `0.25` and rejects
`.5`, `5.`, `007`, `0.250`, `1e3`, and signs, so one value has one encoding.
`root_seed` serializes as a decimal string because canonical JSON caps integers
at 2^53 - 1, and only the form `u64::to_string` produces is accepted back.

## Run identity

`eval_run_id` hashes `(build, simulator_version, config, scenario, root_seed,
random_schema_version, generator_version, eligibility_spec_digest,
linearization_rule_version)` with protocol `eval-run-id/v1`. `build` enters as
the digest (`eval-build/v1`) of the shell-supplied `BuildRecord`: code SHA,
dirty flag, lockfile digest, rustc version, feature set, target triple, and a
binary digest that is either `{"kind": "present", "sha256"}` or
`{"kind": "absent", "reason"}`. The feature set is a `BTreeSet`, so its order
cannot change the identity. A present digest equal to the SHA-256 of zero bytes
is refused; it names no build, and an absent digest needs a non-empty reason.
Empty version strings, a malformed
`eligibility_spec_digest`, and a `config` or `scenario` value canonical JSON
cannot encode are refused by `RunIdentity::validate`, so an identity it accepts
also produces its run ID. There is no seed-only constructor.

## Residue rules

`ObservationSchema` maps every field of one observation type to a `Rule`:

- `Keep`: hashed as observed.
- `Drop`: removed.
- `Presence`: reduced to whether the value is null.
- `Relative`: renumbered by first appearance within one trace, so two runs
  that minted different identifiers for the same objects compare equal while
  merged or swapped identifiers still differ.

`SemanticTrace::record` refuses an observation whose field set differs from
its schema (`UnclassifiedField`, `MissingField`), so classification is total;
registering one type twice is refused (`DuplicateType`), declaring one field
twice in a schema is refused (`DuplicateField`), a field not spelled in
snake_case is refused (`FieldNotSnakeCase`) because the gates below match that
spelling, as is a `Keep` or
`Relative` value canonical JSON cannot encode (`NotCanonical`). A refused
observation leaves the trace and its `Relative` numbering unchanged, so a
recorded trace always digests.
`CLOCK_FIELD_KEEP_ALLOWLIST` (`now_ms`, `observed_at_ms`, `valid_time_ms`)
names the only clock-named fields a schema may keep; any other clock-named
field under `Keep` is refused at schema construction, as is any field named
for a hostname, cwd, pid, or incarnation (`HostFieldKept`). The trace digest
uses protocol `eval-trace/v1`. Rules apply to the top-level fields of an
observation; nested values under `Keep` enter the digest whole.

## Surface census pins

`Surface1Stage` names the thirteen surface-1 stages and `SURFACE1_STAGES`
lists them in production order, so the array index is the ledger ordinal: tail
eligibility, suppression, length gate, token gate, candidate window, match
filter, threshold, cap, render, decision freeze, deferral, overlay apply,
attachment. `SURFACE1_HINT_BOUNDS` pins 100 candidates, 24 query tokens, 3
results, 2 matched tokens, 80-unit fragments, and an 800-unit total. The daemon
census tests compare production behavior against these pins; the pins alone
prove nothing.

## Claim boundary

Every manifest carries `claim-boundary/v1` with the four exclusions:
scheduler-order independence, power-loss durability, wall-clock retention
behavior under manipulated age, and live-model quality. A manifest with a
different block is refused.
